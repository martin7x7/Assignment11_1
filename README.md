## What is the problem?
This project aims to understand which features of a car increase or decrease its sales price.

## Main conclusions from data analysis
1) If the year increases, the car’s price also increases; if the odometer reading increases, the car’s price decreases.
2) Clients value cars the most from these manufacturers – Lexus, RAM, Audi, Toyota, Porsche and GMC. Most sold cars were RAM, Toyota and GMC. There are also sold a lot of Ford, Jeep and Chevrolet cards. However, these type cars are not valued as expensive.
3) Clients think that the least expensive models are from Nissan, Kia, Hyndai, Doge, Volkswagen, also Honda is valued low. Sales are not so big for these models also.
4) Clients want cars which look good and are in “like new” condition. However, there is large part with cars with unknown condition which is a problem for data analysis in this case. One of tow main models also gave good mark for cars with excellent condition.
5) Clients value the most cars with larger engines – in particular, with 8 and 6 cylinders. Also, a lot of 4-cylinder cars are sold. However, these cars clients value as cheaper cars.
6) Cars with diesel engines tend to be more expensive. Gas engine cars tend to be cheaper. However most of cars sold are gas engine cars. There is some demand for diesel cars but most of buyers choose gas.
7) Clients buy cars with clean status. They do not like anything else. These cars are more valuable from clients perspective.
8) With transmission types there is the same situation as with fuel types – most of cars sold are automatic – they are cheaper as manual cars. However, cars with manual cars are sold in small numbers.
9) Cars with 4 wheel drive and rear wheel drive are valued as more expensive and also sell quite good. Front wheel drive cars tend to sell for cheaper prices but also in large quantities.
10) It was not clear form data – what size cars are most preferred – it seems that clients like different size of cars in similar amount. Except sub-compact size cars are sold in smaller quantities.
11) Clients like pickups and trucks. These are valued as expensive. Also convertible cars and coupe cars are valued as expensive but are sold in small quantities. Clients also by SUVs and sedans. However, these cars tend to be cheaper and sold for less money.
12) Clients like black, white and red cars. These are sold in large quantities. Silver cars are also sold in large quantities (also as blue and grey). However, these tend to be cheaper.

## Recomendations for next steps
1) What would be the impact on sales numbers if the car stock were changed in a particular way? To analyse this, the author would need to obtain dealers’ current stock and sales data, model the changes in stock, and then make predictions about potential income.
2) Segmentation of the cars sold might also be useful. For example, identifying what types of cars—by mileage, year, and other attributes—are most valued by clients, as well as which clients value specific types of cars. It would also be important to estimate how many potential clients exist for these car segments.
